""" 
REST API for Shipments. 

Note 1 :
We are using flask_restful, which forces us to create only one of each HTTP Methods,
Thus, we have only one public GET which calls several private ones.

Note 2 : 
The project aims to be more consistent and longer, especially for the front.
This is why some HTTP Methods are not yet called by the front, like DELETE or PUT,
but are still necessary and fully working.
